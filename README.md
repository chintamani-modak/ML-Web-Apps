ML Web Apps using Flask, Streamlit
ML Web Apps
Welcome to the ML Web Apps repository! This project is dedicated to sharing a variety of machine learning projects designed for web applications. By leveraging frameworks like Flask and Streamlit, this repository serves as a practical resource for anyone interested in integrating machine learning into web environments.

Features
Interactive ML Models: Experience machine learning models interactively through web interfaces.
Frameworks: Utilize Flask for more controlled backend development and Streamlit for quick, interactive web apps.
Diverse Applications: Projects cover various use cases and ML techniques suitable for different industry needs.

Projects
Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:
1) Stress levels Prediction Web App: Analyze text input for sentiment using a pre-trained model. Built with Flask. In this project, we dive into the fascinating world of Photoplethysmography (PPG) to predict stress levels. PPG is a non-invasive method that uses infrared light to monitor the volumetric changes in blood circulation, providing a window into the workings of the cardiovascular system.
